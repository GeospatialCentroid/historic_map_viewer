As a young child in Ohio, Caspar Wever Collins gained a passion for nature and artistry from his mother, Catherine. When his father, William Oliver Collins, was commissioned in the United States Army as a Colonel, he was ordered to travel west to help protect telegraph lines and emigrants from the East. Although he was not yet 18 years old, Caspar was determined to go with his father. In March 1862, they left Ohio for St. Louis. Along the route, Caspar recorded the new sites in drawings and letters. The company his father commanded was ordered to move further west, and Caspar recorded the camps and stations they saw in excellent detail and with vivid colors on linen maps. Caspar made maps of most of the forts his father commanded, and these were used officially by the War Department. On 30 June 1863, Caspar was commissioned in the Army as a Second Lieutenant and became part of Company G of the Eleventh Ohio Volunteer Cavalry. In the autumn of 1864, he was assigned responsibility for the garrisons at South Pass, St. Mary's, Sweetwater, and Three Crossings. In February 1865, Caspar was stationed at Deer Creek in Wyoming and promoted to the rank of First Lieutenant on 1 May; however, it is believed that he was not mustered to that position because of a delay in orders. At this time, Army posts and emigrant travelers were suffering from constant Indian raids. The Sand Creek Massacre in Colorado and the hanging of two Indian chiefs at Fort Laramie were two of the major events that provoked the fateful attack on Platte Bridge Station in July 1865. Though rivals in many ventures, Indian tribes banded together to take on the Army and chose Platte Bridge Station as the ideal target because it was one of the most important crossings on the North Platte River. Caspar arrived at Platte Bridge Station late in the night of 25 July and on the morning of the 26th he was ordered to escort a wagon train to the station. Despite the fact that the order was not given by his commander and the mission was clearly suicide, Caspar obeyed. Witnesses estimated three to five thousand Indians were attacking, but were well hidden and their numbers were not realized until it was too late. Caspar's body was found on 28 July, mutilated almost beyond recognition. On 15 August an order was given to have Caspar's remains and belongings collected, with the hope of sending them home at the earliest possible date. Not until nearly a year later, on 24 July 1866 did his remains reach his home of Hillsboro, Ohio, where they were interred. (Spring, pp.32-97) Before her death, Caspar's mother donated his maps of the expedition to Colorado State University, along with several items belonging to his father.",,,,8/31/21,8/31/21,http://cdm17393.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p17393coll70/id/6,6,19.pdfpage,/p17393coll70/image/19.pdfpage

Hand drawn and colored at the scale of 1 inch = 50 feet.","Diagram for Camp Collins on the Cache la Poudre River in Colorado. In the midst of Indian Wars and emigrant migration, Army troops in the West understood the need for forts at defensive locations. In 1864, Colonel William O. Collins issued an order changing the site of Camp Collins from near La Porte to the present day location of Fort Collins. This change was made to ""afford more space for improvement, be free from overflow by high waters, and the interference and injury from lot-holders in the town of La Porte and the settlers and claimants of land in the immediate neighborhood."" (Spring, p. 184) This location was chosen also because it was a defensive location between the Ute, Arapahoe, and Cheyenne tribes. This map is 21"" x 17"" and sits under glass and a matte. A researcher will notice that the map was at one point folded and is marked by dirt stains. Drawn before completion of the camp, this map represents a blueprint of what the camp would eventually look like. Structures are drawn with notes of ""built"" or ""not built,"" and all include dimensions. Although titled and colored, this map does not include a legend. It is scaled at 50 feet to the inch. Today Fort Collins is the biggest city in Northern Colorado, populated by around 170,000 people. Home to Colorado State University, the city hosts many cultural events every year and draws visitors from surrounding states.",,,,,Camp Collins (Colo.) -- Maps; United States. Army.

Hand drawn and colored at the scale of 1 inch = 60 feet.","This fort was built in 1834, and at the time was called Fort William. After sale to a fur trading company in 1835, it was renamed Fort John. The current name came about as the result of a clerical error by a shipping clerk in St. Louis who wrote ""Fort Laramie"" on boxes rather than the proper ""Fort John on the Laramie."" One of the pivotal sites for emigrants and travelers to the West, Fort Laramie was the first permanent settlement of white people in Wyoming. Nearly every group traveling from east to west stopped here for supplies. The United States government bought the fort in 1849 and established it as a military post. In the 1860s Fort Laramie was used as a stopping point for emigrants, a military post, and a location for business with Native American tribes to be conducted. The fort was abandoned in 1890 by the military and its buildings were auctioned off. In 1937, the state of Wyoming bought the land and the remaining ruins and the site were declared a national monument in 1938. (Urbanek, pp.70-71) Caspar Collins' map of Fort Laramie measures 38 x 27 inches and is encapsulated on poster board and covered with mylar. The map is on linen and has been marked by time with wrinkles and dirt stains. This map was at one time folded in half, and ink from the opposite side of the map is visible where it leaked through. There are two small holes in the upper left corner, but they do not interfere with any of the original drawings. This map has a compass guide and is colored, but does not include a legend. It is scaled at 60 feet to the inch. Today, the old site of Fort Laramie is preserved as the Fort Laramie National Historic Site by the National Park Service. Less than ten miles away sits the town of Fort Laramie, with a population of around 300.",,,,,Fort Laramie (Wyo.) -- Maps; United States. Army.

S. Forest Service Bureau of Land Management National Park Service U. S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife U. S Bureau of Reclamation N Scale 1:500,000 Published By COLORADO LAND USE COMMISSION Denver, Colorado January, 1974 Data suppled by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. U.S. Soil Conservation Service, Colorado Board of Land Commissioners, and the Colorado State Forest Service made the compilation of this map possible. State Division of Wildlife and Division of Parks and Outdoor Recreation Military. Atomic Energy Commission, and Department of Commerce Ihe purpose of this map is to delineate patterns ot public and private land holdings, it utilizes eleven classifications ot ownership seven federal, two state, one local, and a single classification for all private land. Federal land holdings encompass o&lt;er 24 million acres in Colorado, approximately 36 percent of the total state land acreage. Federal land grants administered by the state total more than 3 million acres, over 4 percent ot the total land acreage in Colorado Private ownership accounts for 60 percent of total state acreage and covers 42 million acres. Within the private sector are several million acres in which a variety of minerals such as coal. oil. and gas were reserved by the Federal Government While there arc many exceptions, federal land holding patterns generally correspond with certain physical characteristics: topography, soil type, vegetation, ci mate, and mineral resources River valleys, grassy bottomlands, and high plains are largely privately owned The foothills, typified by sagebrush and piton juniper-covered lands, are often administered by the Bureau ot Land Management; and the pine forests and alpine regions at high altitudes arc commonly controlled by the U.S. Forest Service Associated with each ownership classification is a land acquisition and disposition policy which acts as a mayor force m determining the future development patterns for Colorado. The U.S. Forest Service is concerned with consolidation of land ownership within forest boundaries, primarily astride major drainages But the Forest Service has no explicit policy to consolidate ownership as a source of beneficial influence on surrounding lands. Both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management operate with a similar multiple use philosophy; Management of federal lands to achieve a variety of optimum long-range social benefits. Ownership by both agencies is hkety to remain relatively stable but utilization wvj change and intensity to accommodate changing public demands Typocal utilization of federal lands includes management of renewable resources such as watershed lumber and woodland products and native forage production tor wildlife and domestic livestock. Included also are development and production of non-renewable resources, such as base metals, and. increasingly, energy fuels - oil and gas. coal, and uranium Federal lands also serve as transportation and communication routes √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù roads and highways, electrical power and oil and gas pipelines. The public domain also provides a significant and wide range of public outdoor recreation uses. Lands administered by the National Park Service must accommodate a contmumg increase in recreational use which affects the intensity of land use in surrounding areas New land acquisition by the Park Service is expected to be negligible, however, since more attention is being given to averting recreation traffic to areas administered by other public agencies and the private sector. Indian lands arc expected to have a similar policy, that is. negligible land acquisition with increased utilization of service facilities as industry locates on Indian lands Military land ownership may be expanded by the proposed extension ot Fort Carson into Pueblo County However, as the needs of the military change, outdated installations may be closed and possibly transferred to another public agency The state school and grant lands are held m trust by the State Board of Land Commissioners It is the policy of the Board to administer these lands in such a manner, commensurate with a multiple use concept, as to provide the optimum return to the common school funds of the state. State trust lands are to be considered in the same category as private lands for the purpose of planning and land use The State Division of Wildlife and the Division of Parks and Outdoor Recreation are fiscally limited m their powers of acquisition, but do have a potoy of attempting to meet recreation needs of the state's population Privately owned lands are experiencing major development. Most of this development is occurring in the Front Range region. Additional significant pressure is bomg exerted in other regions of the state particularly where private land is adjacent to large docks of public land. w B N E S K A 0 M N G √¢‚Ç¨¬¢Holyoke B √¢‚Ç¨¬¢EsTfc √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ Akron Meeker Kre √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ BOULDER U M R N N DENVER √Ç¬Æ Golden E Georgetown R D E R S O N Rif I rings V co K N √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ Hugo √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ GRAND JUN M S Buffo N N N H √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ DeltB E S (n Salida √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ Eads N W √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ Ordway N W √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ Dove SAN N M N N √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ Springfield N O H √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ Trinidad √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ Conejos w M X √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ Burlington √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ COLORADO SPRINGS R S o N u √¢‚Äì¬† ll D C GUN D E R R √Ç¬ß 0 M A √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ Brighton J R O C if √Ç¬∞ √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ S $1 PRO 1 -√¢‚Äì¬† √¢‚Äì¬† √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù -√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù √¢‚Äì¬† - ""J TP W *√¢‚Äì¬† -√¢‚Äì¬† * √¢‚Äì¬† i* . √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ j √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ L '√¢‚Äì¬† 1 -1 \ √¢‚Äì¬† √¢‚Äì¬† √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ Fort Me J r rgon √¢‚Äì¬† &gt; M PO R- G A √¢‚Äì¬†n √¢‚Äì¬† 1 - √¢‚Äì¬† 1 - -i - _L . √¢‚Äì¬† √¢‚Äì¬† √¢‚Äì¬† 1 M | x √¢‚Äì¬† IKT-.rn-L √¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ j * _&gt;Del Norte * X L P-M O S A V*z* √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù √¢‚Äì¬† - 1 I r √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ Alam- i 1 J ,",,specm_folio_1974_02.jpg,,6/11/25,6/11/25,http://cdm17393.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p17393coll70/id/135,135,136.jpg,/p17393coll70/image/136.jpg

Historically, the majority of Colorado√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s water has been allocated for agricultural purposes. This has resulted m a decline of quantity and quality for residential expansion. Lowering water tables and saline or brackish water in portions of the Denver Basm and eastern third of the state could create problems for future development in such areas Because of the decline in agricultural actrvity in many of Colorado√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mountain vaaeys, prior agricultural water rights m these areas aren t being fully utilized by their present owners Such rights are being purchased for subdivision needs and consequently lost for further agricultural purposes Within Colorado√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Front Range corridor, some of these problems could be solved through adjusted water allocation between agnculturai water uses (presently 90-95 per cent of the total water use here) and anticipated population needs Scattered and isolated subdivision activity in the Front Range is creating water supply problems in areas where the geology and surface and subsurface water conditions preclude economic development for residential use Some conflicts m water use have occurred In mountain subdivision activity because of lack of knowfedge of the physical effects and legal implications of downstream demands Future recreational and residential growth centers on Colorado√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Western Slope could utilize the surplus water supply available there Existing downstream water commitments and continued transmountam diversions for Colorado's Eastern Slope could affect the adequacy of water supply but planned future growth should not conflict with such demands While Colorado has an adequate water supply for controlled growth, the problem of logical planning lies not so much in the location of water sources, but in the allocation, or adjudication of water rights.

SEDIMENT YIELD COLORADO, 1974 Sediment yield as used on this map is defined as the average annual amount of sediment from a square mile transported by water from source areas into local water courses. Th&lt;s scd ment yield represents an average over a long period, such as 25 years or more Much of the quantitative data on the map was based on information derived from smau dry reservoirs with dramage basins of one to live square miles The amounts ot shown, therefore, reflect the average weight and volume ot sediment as ordinarily deposited in such reservoirs The map was compiled using the fo'X&gt;wng sources of data (1) reservoir surveys made Dy the U S Soil Conservation Service. U.S Geological Survey, and U.S. Army Corps ot Engineers; (2) suspended sediment load measurements made Dy the U S Geological Survey. U.S Bureau of Reclamation, and U.S Army Corps ot Engineers; (3) estimates ot sediment yield made using procedures developed Dy the Pacific Southwest Inter-Agency Committee; (4) geologic maps prepared Dy the U.S Geological Survey; and (5) soils, vegetation, land use. and other resource maps prepared Dy the U.S Soil Conservation Service. The most important (actors affecting sediment yield m Colorado are: geology, soils, ctmate. runoff, topography, ground cover, and land use In the procedures developed Dy the Pacific Southwest Inter-Agency Committee for estimating sediment yield in a given area, each of these factors is given a numerical rating, and these ratings are combined to form an overall rating and classification. A brief summary of the effects of those factors follows: Surface Geology √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù Weaker and softer rocks are more easily eroded and generally yield more sed ment than do the harder more resistant types Sandstones and similar coarse- te&gt;tured rocks that disintegrate to form permeable soils erode slower than shales and related mudstones and si-istonos under the same climatic conditions. Manne shales, such as those of the Mancos Formation in western Colorado, are generally highly eroditxe Granite, limestone, and volcanic rock outcrop areas are among the most stable in relation to erosion. Solis - There are essentially three particle sizes - sand. silt, and clay - which may m any combination give soil its physical characteristics Organic substances plus clay provide the binding materials which tend to hod the soil particles together and form aggregates Aggregate formation and stability of these aggregates are the resistant properties of soil against erosion Unstable aggregates or single gram soil materials can Do very crodiDe. Climate and Runoff - Climatic factors are paramount in soil and vegetal development and determine the quantity and discharge rate of runoff The same factors constitute the forces that cause erosion and resultant sediment yield. Likew.se. temperature, precipitation. and particularly the distribution of precipitation during the growing season, affect the quantity and quality of the ground cover as welt as sol development. The typo, quantity, and intensity of precipitation determine the amount and discharge rates ot runoff and resultant erosion of soil and the water transport tor sediment yield Frontal storms and convective thunderstorms of moderate to high intensity precipitation produce the highest sediment yield The average annual sedmient yield is usually kept within moderate bounds by infrequent occurrence of thunderstorms in any one locality. Topography - Watershed slopes, relief, floodplain development, and drainage patterns are basic items to consider in connection with topography However, their influence is closely associated with geology, soils, and vegetabonai cover Generally, steep slopes in rimrock and badlands areas result m rapid runoff and intensive erosion However, high sediment yields from these areas are often modified by the temporary deposition ot √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ediment on intermediate noodptains or alluvial tans The mob mountain ranges, MWough having steep slopes, produce varying quantiles ot sediment depending upon the type of parent material, sori development and vogotational cover wfuch directly affect the erosion processes Generally. the sediment yield IS inversely related to the watershed size because the larger areas usually have less overall slope, smaller proportions ot upland sediment sources, and more opportunity for the deposition of upstream derived sediments on floodplains and fans Ground Cover - Ground cover is described as anything on or above the surface of the ground which alters the effect of precipitation on the soil surface and profile included in this factor are vegetation, litter, and rock fragments A good ground cover dissipates the energy of ramfau before rf strikes the soil surface, delivers water to the soil at a relatively uniform rate, impedes the flow of water, and promotes infiltration by the action of roots within the soil. Conversely, the absence of ground cover, whether through natural growth habits or the effect of overgrazing or fire, leaves the land surface open to the worst effects of storms. In certam areas, small rocks or rock fragments may be so numerous on the surface of the ground that they afford excellent protection tor any underlying line matenai These rocks absorb the energy ot tailing rain and are resistant enough to prevent cutting by (lowing water Land Use - The use of land has a wide variable impact on sediment yield depending on the type and intensity of use Activities such as certain types of cultivation which remove all vegetation have the greatest effect in increasing sediment yield Urban development, road construction, grazing, logging, mining, and fires artificially induce permanent or temporary reduction in cover density. Use of the land has its greatest potential impact on sediment yield where a delicate balance exists under natural conditions Alluvial valleys of (me. easily dispersed soils from shales and sandstones are highly vulnerable to erosion where intensive grazing and tra ng Dy livestock have occurred Valley trenching and gullying have developed in many such valleys and provide targe amounts of sediment from these areas -Widespread destruction of cover by poor logging practices or by brush and timber fires frequently increases channel erosion as well as that on the directly affected watershed slopes The map was prepared to show the general distribution of sediment yield classes and to indicate the more significant sources of sedment in Colorado. Any single map delineation contains smaller inclusions of areas having greater or lesser rates of sediment yield This map should, therefore, be used only for general planning purposes It should not bo used for design purposes at Individual local sites. Investigation and design requ rements tor sediment storage at specific reservoir sites should De done by a qualified engineer or geologist taking into consideration all local site conditions. The base data for this map was supplied Dy Alexander D Elkin. Jr.. U S. Soil Conservation Service. Denver. LEGEND Very high yield (1.0-3.0 acre feet per square mile per year) includes areas consisting mostly of badlands or other severely eroded lands with extensive sheet and rill erosion and numerous deep gullies and streambanks. High yield &lt;05-1.0 acre feet per square mile per year) includes mostly rangelands having much sheet and rill erosion and numerous shallow to moderately deep gullies or a few deep gullies and eroding streambanks. Also includes dry cropland on slopes averaging greater than three percent Moderate yield &lt;0.2-05 acre feet per square mile per year) includes mostly rangelands with some sheet and rill erosion and only a few shallow to moderately deep gullies Also includes dry cropland on slopes averaging less than three percent Low yield (0.1-0.2 acre feet per square mile per year) includes mainly forest lands, grasslands, irrigated cropland, and other areas with a good vegetative cover and only occasional gullies or sites with obvious sheet and rill erosion.

BURNS REP. LARRY E. O 'BRIAN GILBERT F. McNEISH Staff Director April, 1974 The Colorado Land Use Commission is pleased to present you with their newly-published Map Folio √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù containing twelve themes whose data can effectively reinforce State land-use planning efforts in Colorado. The twelve titles in the Map Folio represent three years of effort, by the Land Use Commission, to develop information and coordinate existing data, from federal, state and private sources. This multi-level cooperation has been vital to the effectiveness of the entire Land Use Commission mapping program. Much of the information in this Map Folio is available, as a succinct source for the first time. Moreover, the development of this statewide mapping program is unparalleled in the United States. Inasmuch as the Land Use Commission was charged with the responsibility of encouraging planned and orderly land use development for Colorado, it is their hope that the Map Folios become an essential tool to sound land use decisions. The Land Use Commission is distributing Map Folios to offices at all levels of government within Colorado, dealing with land use planning and management. Additional interested parties may secure Map Folios through the Land Use Commission offices, 1550 Lincoln Street, Denver 80203. Cost of the 12-map folio, including shipping charges, is $10.00.
